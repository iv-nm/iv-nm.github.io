        <h1>Jarvis: Building a Voice Assistant</h1>

        <p>When I watched Iron Man, I was captivated by Tony Stark’s AI assistant, Jarvis. The idea of having a voice assistant that not only responded to commands, optimized daily tasks and improved productivity, but also able to communicate and interact in human manner inspired me. I set out to create my version of Jarvis—an AI-powered assistant designed not just for show but for real-world functionality.</p>

        <h2>The Vision: Beyond Simple Commands</h2>

        <p>Many voice assistants projects today can tell you the time or give you the weather forecast, but I wanted to create something more profound. My goal was to develop a voice assistant that could genuinely optimize my workflow, automate routine tasks, and seamlessly integrate into computer to control it. Jarvis should be more than just a novelty; it should be a tool that enhances productivity and simplifies complex tasks.</p>

        <h2>The Journey: Building the Core</h2>

        <p>Creating such a tool required more than just off-the-shelf solutions. I needed a solid foundation that could handle the nuances of natural language processing and command recognition. After multiple iterations and rebuilding the core logic, I finally developed a robust base that could support the features I envisioned.
        To detect the wake word, I integrated Picovoice AI, a reliable and efficient solution that ensures Jarvis is always ready when called upon. Wake word is needed for fast assistant activation, as it takes much less time to detect one word from sound flow, then listen and process everything. For speech recognition, I opted for Vosk, a model known for its speed and support for multiple languages. This combination allowed me to create a versatile assistant capable of understanding and processing various languages without compromising performance.</p>

        <p>Jarvis listens for the wake word using the Picovoice model, which excels in quickly detecting the word "Jarvis" in real-time, ensuring fast activation.</p>


        <div class="code-container">
            <pre><code class="language-python">
def listen(self):
    self.recorder.start()
    while self.active:
        pcm = self.recorder.read()
        keyword_index = self.porcupine.process(pcm)
        if keyword_index >= 0:
            self.event_queue.put(('detected', 'Jarvis'))
    self.recorder.stop()
            </code></pre>

        </div>



        <p>Once the wake word is detected, the assistant switches to listening for the command using the Vosk speech-to-text library. I chose Vosk because of its speed and its ability to support multiple languages, making it ideal for a versatile voice assistant. However, it doesn’t accurate sometimes, that's enough in my case. I've created several methods for convinient activation and stopping when needed.</p>
        
        
        <div class="code-container">
            <pre><code class="language-python">
                
self.vosk_service.start_listening() #starts listening, returns recognized string 
self.vosk_service.start_listening() #stops listening until activated
            </code></pre>

        </div>
        
        
        <p>After capturing the command, the input string is processed by removing unnecessary words and isolating key action words like "open", "close" etc. I then use the Jaro-Winkler algorithm to compare the command with a predefined list of actions. This algorithm compares input and predefined command letter by letter and them calculate simmilarity score. ensuring accurate matching even if the phrasing isn't exact. </p> 

        <div class="code-container">
            <pre><code class="language-python"># compare input string with predefined commands and return command variable with recognized command

from jellyfish import jaro_winkler_similarity
    command = rc['cmd']
    if rc['similarity'] >= self.similarity_threshold:
        print(f"Processing command: {command}")
        self._execute_command_logic(command)
        return True  # Command was recognized and processed
    else:
        return False  # Command was not recognized
            </code></pre>


        </div>


        <p>This triggers the appropriate action, allowing Jarvis to carry out tasks fast.</p>


        <h2>The Experience: Bringing Jarvis to Life</h2>

        <p>A crucial aspect of Jarvis is its text-to-speech (TTS) capability. That's a huge part od user experience if Jarvis can speak in human manner. I think the best tts tool now is Eleven Labs. It provides high-quality, multi-language speech generation, ensuring that Jarvis doesn’t just sound like a machine but communicates fluently and naturally. However the big issue with Eleven Labs that they process input on their server, in contrast of other tools that I run locally on the machine. Although it works pretty fast.</p>

    </audio>

        <h2>Commands</h2>

        <p>After we know what exactly user sad and what action they want to run, I created commands and shortcuts</p>
        <p>By searching for action words it can process complex commands that contain several actions:</p>
        <p>Input: "open the browser, spotify and close the download folder"</p>



        <div class="code-container">
            <pre><code class="language">
    #The actual list of actions Jarvis can perform smoothly:
    time
    weather
    controlling focus modes on mac
    opening apps and folders
    closing apps

    #Modes:
    Work mode: opens browser, vs code and music app
    Game mode: ends all process, opens steam and discord
            </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>The journey to create Jarvis has been both challenging and rewarding. My primary goal was to create a voice assistant that could truly be useful in my work process—not just a tool for telling time or delivering basic information, but a versatile assistant that could automate tasks, control the environment, and manage information efficiently.
        While the list of commands is continuously evolving, some essentials include making notes, providing information like time and weather, opening programs, and controlling different modes such as focus or gaming mode. As I continue to refine and expand Jarvis, I’m excited about the potential to add even more sophisticated functions.
        In the end, Jarvis is not just a project inspired by a movie. It’s a practical tool designed to enhance productivity and streamline the way I work. By focusing on a strong foundation and continuously improving its capabilities, I aim to make Jarvis a voice assistant that truly serves its purpose—making life a little easier and a lot more efficient.</p>
